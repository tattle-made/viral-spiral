defmodule ViralSpiral.Canon.DynamicCard do
  @moduledoc """
  Changes card text dynamically.

  Viral Spiral card texts have placeholders that get replaced at runtime by the game engine. We call these cards to be having dynamic text. Some examples of dynamic texts in cards are :
  - City revokes docking privileges for (other community) HoBos - "If they like the water so much they can stay there!
  - (oppressed community) ghetto vandalized, burned down during hilarious (popular affinity) day parade hooliganism

  Supported placeholders are : (other community), (dominant community), (oppressed community), (unpopular affinity), (popular affinity).

  ## Example Usage
  ```elixir
  headline = "People who like (unpopular affinity) are usually (dominant community)"
  matches = DynamicCard.find_placeholders(headline)
  replacements = %{
    unpopular_affinity: :skub,
    dominant_community: :red
  }
  new_headline = DynamicCard.replace_text(headline, matches, replacements)
  assert new_headline == "People who like Skub are usually Red"
  ```



  In practice you'd require visibility into the game state to create the replacements map show above. This falls under the responsibility of `ViralSpiral.Room.State.Analytics`
